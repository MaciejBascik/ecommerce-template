            We work with monitoring programmes to ensure compliance with our
            social, environmental and health and safety standards for our
            products. To assess compliance, we have developed a programme of
            audits and continuous improvement plans.

            Lower temperature washes and delicate spin cycles are gentler on
            garments and help to protect the colour, shape and structure of the
            fabric. Furthermore, they reduce the amount of energy used in care
            processes.

            We work with our suppliers, workers, unions and international
            organisations to develop a supply chain in which human rights are
            respected and promoted, contributing to the United Nations
            Sustainable Development Goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to the collaboration with our suppliers, we work to know the
            facilities and processes used to manufacture our products in order
            to understand their traceability.
